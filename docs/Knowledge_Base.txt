# INGRES Knowledge Base for Indian Farmers

## Section 1: Understanding Groundwater and INGRES

### What is Groundwater?

Groundwater is water found beneath the earth's surface in soil and rock layers. It is the primary source of irrigation water for millions of Indian farmers. The Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) and state ground water departments monitor groundwater levels and resources throughout India to ensure sustainable water use.

### What is INGRES?

INGRES stands for India Ground Water Resource Estimation System. It is a GIS-based web application developed by the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) and IIT Hyderabad. INGRES provides:

- Annual assessments of groundwater resources in each block, mandal, or taluk
- Data on groundwater recharge (how much new water enters the aquifer annually)
- Information on extractable groundwater resources (how much can be safely used)
- Total groundwater extraction data (how much is being used)
- Classification of each area into four categories: Safe, Semi-Critical, Critical, or Over-Exploited

### Why is INGRES Important for Farmers?

INGRES helps farmers make informed decisions about:
- Whether to dig new borewells or wells
- How much water they can safely extract for irrigation
- What crops to grow based on water availability
- When to invest in water-saving technologies
- Understanding trends in groundwater levels

The information from INGRES forms the scientific basis for groundwater management and regulation in India.

## Section 2: Groundwater Status Categories

### Category 1: Safe Areas (Extraction Level: 0-70%)

**What it means:** Your block/mandal has abundant groundwater resources and less than 70% of available groundwater is being extracted.

**For Farmers:**
- You can safely dig new borewells and wells
- Groundwater is not under immediate stress
- You have flexibility in crop choices and irrigation practices
- Good time to invest in groundwater-based irrigation for new crops
- Encouraged to adopt standard farming practices

**Action Points:**
- You can increase irrigated area if needed
- Register borewells with local authorities if required
- Consider maintaining groundwater monitoring practices
- Plan for sustainable water use for future generations

### Category 2: Semi-Critical Areas (Extraction Level: 70-90%)

**What it means:** Your block/mandal is approaching groundwater stress. Between 70-90% of available groundwater is being extracted.

**For Farmers:**
- Exercise caution before drilling new borewells
- Need permissions from local water authorities before new well construction
- Groundwater levels are declining and may become critical in the next few years
- Must adopt water-saving technologies
- Crop selection should focus on less water-intensive options

**Action Points:**
- Adopt drip irrigation or sprinkler systems to reduce water use by 30-60%
- Shift to less water-intensive crops (pulses, millets, oilseeds instead of rice, sugarcane)
- Construct farm ponds and rainwater harvesting structures
- Support collective action for groundwater management with other farmers
- Apply for subsidies under PM Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) for micro-irrigation
- Avoid monoculture; practice crop rotation to maintain soil health

### Category 3: Critical Areas (Extraction Level: 90-100%)

**What it means:** Your block/mandal is in critical condition. More than 90% of available groundwater is being extracted, leaving little safety margin.

**For Farmers:**
- Cannot drill new borewells without special permission
- Existing wells may face declining water levels
- Groundwater depletion is happening faster than recharge
- Mandatory adoption of water-saving technologies

## Section 3: Water-Saving Irrigation Techniques

### Drip Irrigation

**What it is:** Water is delivered slowly and directly to plant roots through small pipes and drippers, minimizing water loss.

**Benefits:**
- Saves 40-70% water compared to flood irrigation
- Increases crop yield by 20-50%
- Reduces fertilizer use by 20-40%
- Suitable for vegetables, horticulture, cotton, sugarcane, and spices
- Can be installed on uneven terrain

**Cost & Subsidy:**
- Small and marginal farmers: Up to 80% subsidy under PMKSY
- Other farmers: Up to 70% subsidy
- Typical cost: ₹50,000-₹1,50,000 per hectare (after subsidy: ₹10,000-₹50,000)

**Maintenance:**
- Clean drippers regularly to prevent clogging
- Check for leaks weekly
- Install filters to protect system
- Adjust water schedules seasonally

### Sprinkler Irrigation

**What it is:** Water is sprayed over the field like rainfall from pressurized nozzles or sprinklers.

**Benefits:**
- Saves 30-50% water compared to flood irrigation
- Reduces soil erosion
- Suitable for larger areas
- Good for cereals, pulses, and oilseeds
- Less labor-intensive than drip irrigation

**Cost & Subsidy:**
- Small and marginal farmers: Up to 55% subsidy for portable sprinklers
- Other farmers: Up to 45% subsidy
- Typical cost: ₹30,000-₹1,00,000 per hectare

**Best For:**
- Crops requiring uniform moisture (wheat, maize)
- Areas with sandy soils
- Sloping lands

### Surface Drip Irrigation (SDI)

**What it is:** Drip lines are laid on the soil surface, making it easier to install and maintain than sub-surface systems.

**Advantages Over Traditional Methods:**
- Water and nutrient application directly at root zone
- Reduced evaporation losses
- Better control over water application
- Can be used for multiple crop cycles

### Sub-Surface Drip Irrigation (SSDI)

**What it is:** Drip lines are buried 15-30 cm below the soil surface.

**Advantages:**
- Prevents surface algae growth
- Better for perennial crops and orchards
- More expensive but lasts longer
- Ideal for apple, citrus, pomegranate, and grape farming

## Section 4: Rainwater Harvesting and Groundwater Recharge

### Why Rainwater Harvesting Matters

Rainwater harvesting captures rainfall during monsoon and stores it for dry season use. In areas receiving 600-1000 mm annual rainfall, harvesting 50% of rainwater can meet 30-50% of agricultural water needs.

### Farm Ponds

**What it is:** A small reservoir constructed in the farmer's field to collect and store rainwater runoff.

**Size & Construction:**
- Typical size: 15m × 25m × 3m depth (1000-1500 cubic meters capacity)
- Cost: ₹1-2 lakh for a basic pond
- Lined ponds cost more (₹2-4 lakh) but last longer (15-20 years)
- Unlined ponds last 5-10 years

**Benefits:**
- Stores rainwater during monsoon for dry season irrigation
- Recharges groundwater through percolation
- Supports supplemental irrigation during mid-season droughts
- Can support fish farming for additional income
- Water available for livestock

**Advantages:**
- Farm ponds typically increase crop yields by 20-50%
- Cropping intensity can increase from 100% to 200%
- Returns: ₹30,000-₹50,000 per hectare annually after pond construction

**How to Build:**
1. Choose a location where natural runoff converges
2. Ensure depth at least 2.5-3 meters for maximum storage
3. Use proper sloping (1:1 to 1.5:1) for stability
4. Line if soil has high permeability
5. Install inlet and overflow structures

### Check Dams and Nala Bunds

**What they are:** Small barriers constructed across drainage lines or seasonal streams to slow water flow and increase infiltration.

**Benefits:**
- Charge groundwater aquifers
- Increase water availability in wells downstream
- Reduce soil erosion
- Cost-effective (₹10,000-₹50,000 per structure)

### Percolation Tanks

**What it is:** Open-air tanks designed to allow water to percolate into the ground for aquifer recharge.

**Best for:**
- Areas with sandy or porous soils
- Regions receiving good rainfall
- Alluvial plains

### Rooftop Rainwater Harvesting

**What it is:** Collecting rainwater from house and shed rooftops into storage tanks or groundwater recharge structures.

**Benefits:**
- Improves water availability during dry months
- Reduces demand on borewells
- Improves groundwater levels in the neighborhood
- Simple and low-cost (₹5,000-₹15,000 setup)

### Artificial Recharge Guidelines (CGWB)

**Methods for Farmers:**
1. **Surface spreading:** Spreading water in shallow trenches to allow infiltration
2. **Injection through existing wells:** Using defunct borewells or dug wells to inject treated rainwater
3. **Percolation tanks:** Constructed structures allowing water to percolate
4. **Shaft methods:** Vertical shafts designed to recharge groundwater

**Important Safety Rules:**
- Use only clean rainwater; do not use treated wastewater with heavy metals
- Ensure water enters above the current groundwater level (not below)
- Regular maintenance of recharge structures to prevent clogging
- In limestone areas, use only surface spreading techniques
- Keep recharge structures clean; remove debris regularly

**No Recharge Recommended In:**
- Areas with water levels already less than 3 meters below ground (in post-monsoon)
- Industrial or chemical waste areas
- Areas prone to waterlogging
- Areas with saline water nearby

## Section 8: Borewell and Well Guidelines

### Before Drilling: Check with Authorities

**Areas Where NEW Borewells Are Restricted:**
- Critical areas (extraction 90-100%): Permission required; often denied
- Over-exploited areas (>100% extraction): No new wells allowed except for drinking water
- Semi-critical areas (70-90%): Permission from district water authority required

**How to Check Your Area Status:**
1. Visit INGRES website (https://ingres.iith.ac.in/home) or contact CGWB
2. Enter your district, block/taluk, and mandal
3. Check status category: Safe, Semi-Critical, Critical, or Over-Exploited
4. Apply for permission if needed before drilling

### Borewell Depth Guidelines

**Depth Determination:**
- Minimum depth: Below the current water table (typically 10-30 meters in most areas)
- Maximum depth: Usually 60-100 meters; beyond this becomes very costly
- Rock formations matter: Hard rock areas need deeper wells (50-100 meters)
- Alluvial plains: Shallower wells possible (20-40 meters)

**Consult Experts:**
- Hire qualified borewell drillers licensed by state groundwater authority
- CGWB guidelines recommend specific depths based on geological surveys
- Do not exceed recommended depths without approval

### Borewell Construction Requirements

**Casing and Sealing:**
- Use corrosion-resistant casing material (PVC or mild steel)
- Install sanitary seal or cap to prevent surface water entry
- Proper grouting to prevent contamination

**Water Meter Installation:**
- Mandatory in many states
- Helps track water extraction
- Helps identify leaks and wastage

**Record Keeping:**
- Maintain records of well location (latitude/longitude)
- Note rock formations encountered
- Record initial yield and changes over time
- Submit quarterly water extraction reports to authorities

### Artificial Recharge is Mandatory

**Where Required:**
- Over-exploited and critical areas
- Concurrent with borewell construction
- Reduces extraction impact on aquifers

**Farmer's Responsibility:**
- Dedicate at least 10-20% of extracted water for artificial recharge
- Construct rainwater harvesting structure if borewell is new
- Maintain recharge structures

---

## Section 9: Sustainable Farming Practices

### Crop Rotation

**Benefits:**
- Breaks pest and disease cycles
- Reduces fertilizer dependence

## Section 11: Common FAQs for Farmers

### Q: What does "stage of groundwater extraction" mean?

**A:** It is a percentage showing how much of the available groundwater is being used annually.
- 0-70%: Safe (more water available than being used)
- 70-90%: Semi-Critical (water available but usage high)
- 90-100%: Critical (very limited buffer; almost all water in use)
- >100%: Over-Exploited (more water used than nature can replenish; mining groundwater)

### Q: How is groundwater recharge measured?

**A:** Recharge is the amount of new groundwater added to aquifers annually through:
- Monsoon rainfall infiltration
- Irrigation water seepage
- Return flow from wells and canals
- Artificial recharge structures

CGWB measures this scientifically and reports in INGRES for each block.

### Q: Can I drill a borewell in a critical area?

**A:** In critical areas, the answer is mostly no:
- New agricultural borewells generally NOT permitted
- Drinking water borewells may be allowed in special cases
- You must get permission from district water authority
- Your application will likely be rejected unless critical need proven
- Better to apply for subsidy to use surface water or reinforce existing structures

### Q: What is the difference between "safe extraction" and "over-exploitation"?

**A:** 
- **Safe extraction:** Using water at sustainable rate; aquifer can replenish annually
- **Over-exploitation:** Using water faster than nature can replenish; aquifer depletes each year
- When extraction >100%, groundwater becomes exhausted over time; wells eventually dry

### Q: How much water does drip irrigation actually save?

**A:** Drip irrigation saves:
- 40-70% water compared to flood irrigation
- Water savings depend on crop type and soil type
- Sandy soils: Higher savings (60-70%)
- Clayey soils: Lower savings (40-50%)
- Combined with mulching, savings can exceed 70%

### Q: Is rainwater harvesting enough to meet all my water needs?

**A:** Typically, no:
- Farm ponds capture monsoon runoff, typically meeting 30-50% of annual irrigation need
- Rest must come from groundwater or canal systems
- However, harvesting significantly extends groundwater sustainability
- Combining harvesting + drip irrigation + crop shift = Most effective approach

### Q: What crops can I grow if my area is over-exploited?

**A:** Priority crops:
- Bajra, Jowar, Ragi (millets): Require only 300-500 mm water
- Pulses: Tur, Moong, Urad (400-600 mm)
- Oilseeds: Groundnut, sesame (500-700 mm)
- Only irrigated vegetables with drip system
- Livestock-based livelihoods (dairy, goat rearing)
- Note: Rice and sugarcane must be completely avoided

### Q: How do I know if my well water is safe to drink?

**A:** Get it tested annually for:
- Bacterial contamination
- Chemical contamination (nitrate, arsenic, fluoride)
- Salinity/TDS (Total Dissolved Solids)

Contact your local health department or water quality lab for testing. CGWB publishes Annual Ground Water Quality Report.

### Q: What should I do if I see illegal borewells being dug in my area?

**A:** Report to:
- District Water Authority
- Local Gram Panchayat
- CGWB regional office
- Police (if large-scale operation)

Illegal borewells accelerate groundwater depletion and affect everyone's water security.

### Q: Can I get subsidy for multiple types of irrigation?

**A:** Under PMKSY:
- Drip irrigation subsidy: Up to 80% for small farmers
- Additional subsidy for related works: Up to 50% (well construction, farm pond)
- Maximum area: 5 hectares per farmer
- One farmer: Cannot get double subsidy for same land; can get it on different plots

### Q: How often should I check my water level?

**A:** Recommended frequency:
- Monthly: Best practice for monitoring trends
- Quarterly: Minimum monitoring frequency
- Pre-monsoon and post-monsoon: Essential for identifying changes
- Compare year-over-year data to identify declining trends

### Q: What is the best time to construct a farm pond?

**A:** 
- Best: May-July (before monsoon) so it fills during monsoon
- Can be done: Year-round with proper planning
- Better to complete before monsoon to capture maximum water
- For irrigation readiness: Complete by June to capture July-September monsoon

### Q: Can I use treated wastewater for artificial recharge?

**A:** No:
- CGWB explicitly prohibits treated wastewater for groundwater recharge
- Treated water may contain heavy metals or toxic elements
- Can contaminate aquifers for decades
- Treated wastewater should be reused for surface irrigation only

### Q: What is "saline groundwater"?

**A:** Groundwater with high salt content (TDS >2000 mg/L):
- Cannot be used for irrigation (damages soil and crops)
- Cannot be used for drinking (health hazard)
- Some blocks classified as "Saline" have this problem
- Farmers in such areas must seek alternative water sources

## Section 15: Regional Variations in Water Stress

### High-Risk States for Groundwater Depletion

**Over-Exploited Areas:**
- Punjab (165-170% extraction): Severe stress due to rice cultivation
- Haryana (165-170% extraction): Similar issues to Punjab
- Rajasthan (165-170% extraction): Desert state with high extraction
- Delhi (98% extraction): Critical level
- Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Daman & Diu: Over 130% extraction

**Semi-Critical and Critical Areas:**
- Uttar Pradesh: Parts of eastern UP in critical range
- Tamil Nadu: Multiple critical blocks, especially in interior areas
- Telangana and Andhra Pradesh: Several critical blocks
- Gujarat: Coastal and central areas increasingly stressed
- Madhya Pradesh: Southern parts showing stress

### Regional Best Practices

**Punjab/Haryana (Over-Exploited):**
- Must urgently shift from rice to less water-intensive cereals and pulses
- Direct-Seeded Rice (DSR) for any remaining rice: Saves water and labor
- 100% mandatory drip irrigation adoption
- Groundnut, pulses as alternative crops

**Rajasthan (Over-Exploited):**
- Bajra and Jowar as primary crops
- Mustard as winter crop (low water)
- Aloe Vera farming gaining popularity (profitable, low-water)
- Desert-adapted horticulture (dates, cacti, etc.)

**Southern States (Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana):**
- Pulses and millets as alternatives to rice
- Summer groundnut and sunflower
- Sugarcane ONLY in absolutely safe blocks with proper irrigation management
- Horticultural crops (citrus, mango, coconut) where feasible

**Western States (Gujarat, Maharashtra):**
- Cotton widely grown but requires drip irrigation
- Oilseeds as major alternative
- Millets and pulses in dryland areas
- Multiple cropping systems for water efficiency

## Section 16: Monitoring Your Own Groundwater

### DIY Water Level Monitoring

**Simple Method - Rope and Weight:**
1. Tie a weight (stone or iron piece) to a rope
2. Lower rope until weight hits water surface
3. Pull up rope, mark where water line was
4. Measure distance from ground to mark = Water depth
5. Record monthly in a notebook with date and season

**Limitations:**
- Not very precise (±0.5 meter error)
- Difficult in very deep wells (>30 meters)
- Dug wells only (won't work for bore wells)

### Interpretation of Trends

**Positive Trends (Water Improving):**
- Water level shallower each monsoon (rising groundwater)
- Seasonal drops smaller than previous year
- New wells successful where old ones failed previously

**Negative Trends (Water Depleting):**
- Water level deeper each year
- Well drying earlier in summer compared to last year
- Need for deeper extraction (pump installation moved deeper)
- Neighboring wells drying up

**Action When Negative Trend Detected:**
- Start water conservation immediately (don't wait)
- Shift crops if area is semi-critical
- Apply for drip irrigation subsidy
- Construct farm pond during monsoon

## Section 18: Frequently Encountered Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: "My neighbor just drilled a deep well, and my water level dropped"

**Why It Happens:**
- Groundwater is interconnected (shared aquifer)
- New extraction lowers water table for everyone
- Over-extraction by few affects all
- Cumulative effect of many new wells critical

**Solution:**
- Report to district water authority
- Check if new well had proper permission
- If over-exploited/critical area, likely illegal
- Join community action to prevent further illegal drilling

### Challenge 2: "Subsidy application rejected, reason unknown"

**Common Reasons:**
- Land ownership certificate not valid
- Applied in over-exploited area (automatic rejection)
- Incomplete documentation
- Application already submitted for same land
- Priority given to SC/ST/Women (category-wise priority)

**Solution:**
- Ask for detailed reason in writing
- Check land documents again; renew if expired
- Reapply after clarification
- If area is critical, appeal citing water emergency
- Seek help from agricultural extension officer

### Challenge 3: "I can't afford drip irrigation even with subsidy"

**Why:**
- Farmer share can still be ₹20,000-50,000 even with 80% subsidy
- Some areas have droughts reducing ability to invest

**Solutions:**
- Apply for MGNREGS to do farm pond (builds water source for future)
- Look for farmer producer organizations offering bulk purchase (cheaper)
- Government sometimes offers additional grants in drought years
- Phase implementation: Start with small area (0.5 hectare)
- Connect with bank for agricultural loan (with subsidy, easier loan approval)

### Challenge 4: "Drip irrigation installed, but water pressure too low"

**Why It Happens:**
- Borewell yield too low (not enough water output)
- Pump capacity insufficient
- Clogging in main line or drippers

**Solution:**
- Test borewell yield: Check if it recovers water after 2-3 hours of rest
- If yield low, can only irrigate part of land or reduce irrigation time
- Install booster pump to increase pressure
- Regular maintenance: Clean filters, unclog drippers
- Consult drip irrigation technician

### Challenge 5: "Government officers are not helping; feel ignored"

**Why It Happens:**
- High workload on staff
- Priority given to large farmer groups
- Lack of awareness about existing schemes
- Corruption in some cases

**Action:**
- Contact agricultural extension officer first (more approachable)
- Document issues in writing; follow up formally
- Connect with farmer groups for collective representation
- Contact block/district agriculture department directly
- Escalate to state agriculture ministry if needed

### Challenge 6: "Water quality is bad; crops not growing well"

**Possible Issues:**
- High salinity (salt content)
- High iron or arsenic
- High fluoride
- Contamination from industrial or municipal waste

**Solution:**
- Get water quality test done (through health department)
- Identify contaminant
- If salinity: Consider salt-tolerant crops or treat water
- If natural contamination (arsenic, fluoride): May require water treatment or alternative source
- If industrial: Report to district environmental authority (Pollution Control Board)

## Section 19: Success Stories and Examples

### Example 1: Farmer in Semi-Critical Block (Rajasthan)

**Situation:** Block water extraction was 78% (semi-critical). Farmer was growing sugarcane, took 3-4 hours to fill a tank.

**Actions Taken:**
1. Applied for PMKSY subsidy for drip irrigation (80% for small farmer)
2. Invested ₹60,000 own share (after ₹2,40,000 subsidy)
3. Constructed 2,000 cubic meter farm pond with MGNREGS support
4. Shifted 50% crop area from sugarcane to moong dal and groundnut

**Results:**
- Water extraction time reduced from 3-4 hours to 1-1.5 hours
- Crop yield maintained despite reduced water use
- Additional income from farm pond: Supplemental irrigation and fish farming (₹20,000/year)
- Net income increased ₹30,000-40,000 annually after initial investment recovered

### Example 2: Farmer in Critical Block (Punjab)

**Situation:** Block extraction 94% (critical). Farmer was still growing rice. Well required 2 hours daily pumping.

**Actions Taken:**
1. Switched 70% area from rice to moong dal, groundnut, and bajra
2. Applied for group subsidy with 15 other farmers (stronger application)
3. Installed drip irrigation on remaining rice area (Direct-Seeded Rice method)
4. Participated in community artificial recharge project (check dams)

**Results:**
- Water availability improved within 2 years (more farmers reduced extraction)
- Moong dal income ₹50,000/hectare vs rice ₹30,000/hectare
- Reduced water stress; less financial pressure
- Became community champion for water conservation

### Example 3: Farmer in Over-Exploited Block (Haryana)

**Situation:** Block extraction 165% (severely over-exploited). Farmer had 3 borewells; 2 dried up.

**Actions Taken:**
1. Abandoned agriculture; started dairy farming with reduced water for fodder
2. Shifted remaining crop area to bajra and pulses only (minimal irrigation)
3. Installed solar panels for pumping (reduced electricity cost, environment benefit)
4. Registered for PM-KISAN income support

**Results:**
- Dairy income ₹80,000-1,00,000/month (vs agriculture ₹30,000/month)
- Water extraction reduced by 80%
- More stable and reliable income
- Contributing to community water recovery
